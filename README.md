# ARlearning
A project in which we look to build an AR solution for mathematics learning.

In this repo you can find all project files and assets for the MATHBUILDER game.

To be able to build this properly make sure that you have a working up to date version of the Unity editor installed, as well as downloading the Vuforia engine. Make sure to set the correct path and configure Vuforia once you open the project.

If you are just looking to run a working version of the app, there was an APK folder that comes with the project in which you can find a working android APK, however the file size is too big to upload directly to Github.
As such, if you want the android apk file, you can contact me directly.
